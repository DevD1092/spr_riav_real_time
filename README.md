# spr_riav_real_time
This repositorty contains the source code for the real-time implementation of the star pattern recognition technique based on rotation-invariant additive vector sequence in the research paper "A rotation-invariant additive vector sequence based star pattern recognition" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8430566/).

Please cite our paper (citation details below) properly, if you use the code for simulation, development or testing of a new star identification algorithm or comparison & benchmarking with the above-mentioned alogirhtm.

This code is only for academic and research purposes. Commerical use of this code is not permitted.

## Repository details

This repository contains two folders. The information about each of the folder is described as below.

#### 1. SPD - SPD.bin file
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SPD_vp.bin -- This SPD file is generated from the corresponding SPD_vect_patt file. <br />

#### 2. src -- Source code files
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This folder contains all the source code files for implementing the star pattern recognition in C. Paths for the input of the SPD and the input star image will have to be changed.
